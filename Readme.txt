LCMSFeatureFinder_VB\LCMSFeatureFinder.sln (LCMSFeatureFinder.exe) is designed for LC-MS data, 
for example from an Orbitrap or Q-Exactive. It is used by VIPER when creating LC-MS Features (UMCs).  
It uses C++ DLLs UMCCreation.dll and UMCManipulation.dll

Solution LCMSFeatureFinder.sln (FeatureFinder.exe) is obsolete.
